      "Article 58 of the Portuguese Penal Code provides for the application of community service as an alternative penalty. This measure is intended to rehabilitate offenders through their integration into society and their contribution to the common good. The conditions, including the duration and location of community service, are determined by the court based on the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the offender (Source: Codigo Penal Português, Artigo 58). Community service aims to allow offenders to make amends for their actions while avoiding the stigma and potential consequences of a criminal record, as well as reduce overcrowding in prisons and promote social reintegration (Direito Processual Penal Parte 3, Princípio da investigação, nota 4 - Medidas Alternativas à Prisão). However, community service is not an automatic right and is granted at the discretion of the court, considering the individual circumstances and the needs of the community (implicit from the text).\n",

While the parties have the right to request production of evidence and appeal, the judge has the power-duty to investigate the facts subject to trial on their own motion, even if not presented by either party. This is in line with the principles of Portuguese criminal procedure, which does not lead to a purely adversarial model. Furthermore, the publicity of the hearing is generally mandatory, except in certain circumstances where the president decides to exclude or restrict it. The instruction phase aims to confirm whether charges should be filed or an investigation closed for submission to trial, and is optional. The Portuguese criminal procedural model involves a unitary hearing that can be reopened at the end to discuss only matters relating to the bipartite sanction due to the weight of requirements related to the agent's conditions in determining the measure of the sentence. In the investigation phase, authorities release the accused and transmit the case to the public prosecutor's office with an order if it is a judicial authority. The purpose of this stage is to investigate the existence of a crime, determine its agents, and ensure justice and fairness through reducing duration and costs associated with criminal proceedings. The Portuguese Penal Code establishes that any person who commits an offense punishable by law shall be liable for its punishment regardless of whether it is a crime or an administrative offense, and the penalty shall be determined based on the type, gravity, and circumstances of the offense committed, known as \"principio de tipologia penal.\"No procedimento criminal português, o juiz tem tarefas passivas e ativas durante a fase de investigação. Embora as partes tenham o direito de solicitar a produção de evidências e apelo, o juiz tem o poder de investigar os fatos sujeitos a julgamento por sua própria moção, mesmo que não fossem apresentados por qualquer uma das partes. Isso está de acordo com os princípios do procedimento criminal português, que não leva a um modelo puramente adversário. Além disso, a publicidade da audiência é geralmente obrigatória, exceto em certas circunstâncias em que o presidente decide excluí -la ou restringir. A fase de instrução visa confirmar se as cobranças devem ser arquivadas ou uma investigação fechada para submissão ao julgamento e é opcional. O modelo processual criminal português envolve uma audiência unitária que pode ser reaberta no final para discutir apenas assuntos relacionados à sanção bipartida devido ao peso dos requisitos relacionados às condições do agente na determinação da medida da sentença. Na fase de investigação, as autoridades liberam o acusado e transmitem o caso ao escritório do promotor público com uma ordem, se for uma autoridade judicial. O objetivo deste estágio é investigar a existência de um crime, determinar seus agentes e garantir justiça e justiça através da redução da duração e dos custos associados aos procedimentos criminais. O Código Penal português estabelece que qualquer pessoa que comete uma ofensa punível por lei será responsável por sua punição, independentemente de ser um crime ou uma ofensa administrativa, e a penalidade será determinada com base no tipo, gravidade e circunstâncias do Ofensas cometidas, conhecidas como \"Penal de Tipologia Penal\".\n",

      "Assistant's Answer: Article 1 of the Portuguese Penal Code establishes the principle of legality, which states that only actions defined and punishable by law at the time of their commission can be subject to criminal penalties. This means that individuals cannot be convicted for actions that were not considered crimes under the existing legal framework at the time they were committed. The Portuguese Penal Code ensures that citizens are aware of what is deemed a criminal offense, and any potential consequences of such acts.

      "In Portuguese criminal procedure, the role of the judge during the preliminary hearing is not limited to observing the evidence presented by the parties involved. The judge has a proactive duty to investigate the facts subject to trial through their own motion, as mentioned in the source document \"Principles of Portuguese Criminal Procedure.\" (page 0) This means that the judge can request evidence not presented by either the prosecution or the defense. Additionally, during the hearing, the judge has the authority to clarify any doubts or inconsistencies regarding the case and ensure compliance with legal procedures and human rights standards. The preliminary hearing is a crucial stage in the process because it allows all parties involved to present their arguments before the case moves forward, which contributes to ensuring fairness and efficiency in the proceedings.

This law provides specific circumstances under which assistance or incitement to suicide may be allowed, such as in cases of serious illness or disability where the person's life has become unbearable and they request help to end it. However, if these conditions are not met, and the act is done with the intent to cause death, it could still fall under the category of homicide, which is punishable under other sections of the Penal Code.\n",

      "In terms of the penalty for attempting a crime in Portugal, Article 23 of the Penal Code states that unless otherwise specified, the attempt is only punishable if the respective completed crime corresponds to a sentence of more than three years in prison. The attempt itself is punishable by the same penalty as the completed offense, but with mitigating circumstances taken into account, such as the ineptitude of the means used or the non-existence of the essential object for consummation of the crime being manifest. Additionally, Article 24 allows for withdrawal from a criminal attempt, whereby the agent voluntarily gives up continuing to execute the crime, prevents its consummation, or prevents verification of the result not included in the type of crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recidivism is also taken into account when determining penalties in Portugal, as outlined in Article 76 of the Penal Code. This refers to a person who has previously been convicted of a crime and is being tried again for another offense. The sentence or security measure depriving liberty, amnesty, generic pardon, or pardon do not prevent verification of recidivism.\n",
      "\n",
      "In cases where foreign criminal sentences are involved, they must be reviewed and confirmed if legally required in the country where the crime was committed. This is outlined in Article 469 of the Portuguese Code of Criminal Procedure, which establishes that the Public Prosecutor's Office is responsible for promoting the execution of sentences and security measures, as well as the execution of foreign criminal sentences that have been reviewed and confirmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the answer to whether assisting or inciting suicide is punishable in Portugal depends on the specific circumstances surrounding the act, while the penalty for attempting a crime varies based on the severity of the completed offense and other mitigating factors. Recidivism is also taken into account when determining penalties, and foreign criminal sentences must be reviewed and confirmed if required by the country where the crime was committed.Em relação à questão de se ajudar ou incitar o suicídio é punível em Portugal, de acordo com o artigo 135 do Código Penal Português, a resposta é que ele não é automaticamente punível desde que seja realizado em conformidade com as condições estabelecidas na lei no. 22/2023. Essa lei fornece circunstâncias específicas sob as quais a assistência ou incitação ao suicídio pode ser permitida, como em casos de doença grave ou deficiência, onde a vida da pessoa se tornou insuportável e solicita ajuda para encerrá -la. No entanto, se essas condições não forem atendidas e a lei for feita com a intenção de causar morte, ela ainda poderá se enquadrar na categoria de homicídio, que é punível em outras seções do Código Penal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Em termos de penalidade por tentar um crime em Portugal, o artigo 23 do Código Penal afirma que, a menos que especificado de outra forma, a tentativa só é punível se o respectivo crime concluído corresponder a uma sentença de mais de três anos de prisão. A tentativa em si é punível com a mesma penalidade que a ofensa completa, mas com circunstâncias atenuantes levadas em consideração, como a inaptidão dos meios usados ​​ou a inexistência do objeto essencial para a consumação do crime que se manifesta. Além disso, o artigo 24 permite a retirada de uma tentativa criminal, pela qual o agente desiste voluntariamente, continua a executar o crime, impede sua consumação ou impede a verificação do resultado não incluído no tipo de crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reincidência também é levada em consideração ao determinar penalidades em Portugal, conforme descrito no artigo 76 do Código Penal. Isso se refere a uma pessoa que já foi condenada por um crime e está sendo tentada novamente por outra ofensa. A sentença ou medida de segurança privando a liberdade, anistia, perdão genérico ou perdão não impedem a verificação da reincidência.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nos casos em que as sentenças criminais estrangeiras estão envolvidas, elas devem ser revisadas e confirmadas se legalmente exigidas no país onde o crime foi cometido. Isso está descrito no artigo 469 do Código de Processo Penal português, que estabelece que o Ministério Público é responsável por promover a execução de sentenças e medidas de segurança, bem como a execução de sentenças criminais estrangeiras que foram revisadas e confirmadas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Em resumo, a resposta para ajudar ou incitar o suicídio é punível em Portugal, depende das circunstâncias específicas em torno da Lei, enquanto a penalidade por tentar um crime varia com base na gravidade da ofensa concluída e outros fatores atenuantes.

      "Indigenous peoples in Canada are protesting against the proposed Enbridge pipeline project due to its potential environmental impact and threat to traditional lands and waterways. The CBC reported that native communities in British Columbia oppose the pipeline as it poses risks to fragile ecosystems and drinking water sources for indigenous communities. Indigenous peoples have long-standing treaty rights and inherent rights, recognized by the Canadian Supreme Court, such as authority over their lands and resources and the right to practice cultural traditions and self-determination. Many indigenous communities in British Columbia have launched legal challenges against the pipeline project on the grounds that the government failed to adequately consult with First Nations communities before making its decision. Greenpeace and other environmental organizations also oppose the pipeline as it would contribute to climate change by facilitating continued development of Alberta’s tar sands, which is an increasingly popular method of extracting crude oil due to rising oil prices and advancements in technology but is more environmentally destructive than traditional methods. The proposed Enbridge pipeline would carry bitumen, a thick and heavy form of oil extracted from tar sands, to the Pacific coast for export. Some native communities view the pipeline project as an infringement on their sovereignty and cultural heritage. While some native communities are divided over whether to support the project due to potential economic benefits, others have voiced opposition, with Chief Roland Leautiere of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation stating, \"This is our home. We’re not going to let them come in and destroy it for a quick buck.\" The Enbridge proposal is currently under review by the National Energy Board, an independent federal agency that regulates energy development and transportation projects in Canada.Os povos indígenas no Canadá estão protestando contra o projeto proposto de oleoduto Enbridge devido ao seu potencial impacto ambiental e ameaça às terras e hidrovias tradicionais. A CBC relatou que as comunidades nativas da Colúmbia Britânica se opõem ao oleoduto, pois representa riscos para ecossistemas frágeis e fontes de água potável para comunidades indígenas. Os povos indígenas têm direitos de tratados de longa data e direitos inerentes, reconhecidos pela Suprema Corte do Canadá, como autoridade sobre suas terras e recursos e o direito de praticar tradições culturais e autodeterminação. Muitas comunidades indígenas na Colúmbia Britânica lançaram desafios legais contra o projeto de pipeline, alegando que o governo não conseguiu consultar adequadamente as comunidades das Primeiras Nações antes de tomar sua decisão. O Greenpeace e outras organizações ambientais também se opõem ao oleoduto, pois contribuiria para as mudanças climáticas, facilitando o desenvolvimento contínuo das areias de alberta, que é um método cada vez mais popular de extrair petróleo bruto devido ao aumento dos preços e avanços do petróleo na tecnologia, mas é mais ambientalmente destrutivo do que Métodos tradicionais. O oleoduto Enbridge proposto levaria betume, uma forma grossa e pesada de óleo extraída de areias betuminosas, até a costa do Pacífico para exportação. Algumas comunidades nativas vêem o projeto de pipeline como uma violação de sua soberania e patrimônio cultural. Enquanto algumas comunidades nativas estão divididas sobre apoiar o projeto devido a potenciais benefícios econômicos, outros expressaram oposição, com o chefe Roland Leautiere da nação de Tsleil-Waututh, afirmando: \"Esta é a nossa casa.

      "Based on the provided research, the main features of the Portuguese juvenile justice system include a priority on diversion, prevention, rehabilitation, protection, and collaboration. Diversion involves redirecting young people away from the formal criminal justice system and into less punitive, more supportive community-based programs instead. Prevention measures aim to reduce youth crime through initiatives focused on improving social inclusion, education, and employment opportunities for young people, as well as addressing risk factors such as poverty, family breakdown, and substance abuse. Rehabilitation is prioritized over punishment, with the use of alternative measures such as community service orders, probation, and mediation to address the underlying causes of youth offending and promote positive behavior change. Protection is ensured by provisions for legal representation, access to education and healthcare, and restrictions on detention as a last resort. Collaboration between different stakeholders, including youth, their families, schools, and community organizations, is emphasized to address youth offending and prevent reoffending through early intervention, multi-disciplinary approaches, and evidence-based practices tailored to meet the specific needs of young people.

O desvio envolve redirecionar os jovens para longe do sistema formal de justiça criminal e para programas comunitários menos punitivos e mais solidários. As medidas de prevenção visam reduzir o crime juvenil por meio de iniciativas focadas em melhorar a inclusão social, a educação e as oportunidades de emprego para os jovens, além de abordar fatores de risco como pobreza, quebra familiar e abuso de substâncias. A reabilitação é priorizada em relação à punição, com o uso de medidas alternativas, como ordens de serviço comunitário, liberdade condicional e mediação para abordar as causas subjacentes dos jovens ofensores e promover mudanças positivas de comportamento. A proteção é garantida pelas disposições para representação legal, acesso à educação e saúde e restrições à detenção como último recurso.

      "Based on the provided research, it can be summarized that recidivism is addressed in the Portuguese Penal Code through a focus on prevention, rehabilitation, and reintegration into society. The system prioritizes rehabilitation over punishment and employs multidisciplinary approaches to address the root causes of juvenile offenders and promote positive behavioral changes. The legal definition of recidivism is outlined in Article 76, which considers the gravity of the new offense in relation to previous ones (including foreign convictions) and does not impede recidivism verification for cases of prescription, amnesty, general pardon or pardon.\n",

Harsher penalties apply to public officials and company executives due to the potential harm caused by their position of trust or authority over financial resources. Other related crimes mentioned include fraud related to work or employment (Article 222), extortion (Article 223), loans, promises, or obligations for values (Article 376), and embezzlement abroad aimed at unlawful enrichment (Article 222).
